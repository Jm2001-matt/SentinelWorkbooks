Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Resource Development</p>The adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations. Resource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating, purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting. Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities. These resources can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using purchased domains to support Command and Control, email accounts for phishing as a part of Initial Access, or stealing code signing certificates to help with Defense Evasion. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0042/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/InitialAccess.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Initial Access\"><p style=\"color:orange;\">Initial access</p>Techniques used by the adversary to obtain a foothold within a network, such as targeted spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities or configuration weaknesses in public-facing systems. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Execution.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Execution\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Execution</p>Techniques that result in an adversary running their code on a target system. For example, an attacker may run a PowerShell script to download additional attacker tools and/or scan other systems. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Persistence.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Persistence\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Persistence</p>Techniques that allow an adversary to maintain access to a target system, even following reboots and credential changes. An example of a persistence technique would be an attacker creating a scheduled task that runs their code at a specific time or on reboot. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/PrivilegeEscalation.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Privilege escalation\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Privilege escalation</p>Techniques leveraged by an adversary to gain higher-level privileges on a system, such as local administrator or root. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/DefenseEvasion.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Defense evasion\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Defense evasion</p>Techniques used by attackers to avoid detection. Evasion techniques include hiding malicious code within trusted processes and folders, encrypting or obfuscating adversary code, or disabling security software. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/CredentialAccess.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Credential access\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Credential access</p>Techniques deployed on systems and networks to steal usernames and credentials for re-use. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Discovery.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Discovery\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Discovery</p>Techniques used by adversaries to obtain information about systems and networks that they are looking to exploit or use for their tactical advantage. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/LateralMovement.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Lateral Movement\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Lateral movement</p>Techniques that allow an attacker to move from one system to another within a network. Common techniques include “Pass-the-Hash” methods of authenticating users and the abuse of the remote desktop protocol. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Collection.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Collection\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Collection</p>Techniques used by an adversary to gather and consolidate the information they were targeting as part of their objectives. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0009/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/CommandandControl.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Command and Control\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Command and Control</p>Techniques leveraged by an attacker to communicate with a system under their control. One example is that an attacker may communicate with a system over an uncommon or high-numbered port to evade detection by security appliances or proxies. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Exfiltration.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Exfiltration\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Exfiltration</p>Techniques used to move data from the compromised network to a system or network fully under control of the attacker. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/Impact.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Impact\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">Impact</p>Techniques used by an attacker to impact the availability of systems, networks, and data. Methods in this category would include denial of service attacks and disk- or data-wiping software. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/\" target=\"_blank\">See Techniques</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rod-trent/AzureSentinelMisc/blob/master/preattack.png?raw=true\" alt=\"PreAttack\"><h2><p style=\"color:orange;\">PreAttack</p>(PRE-ATT&CK has now been deprecated for Reconnaissance and Resource Development.)</h2> \r\n\r\n</div>"
